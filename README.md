# Food Truck Project

## Overview
Users will input and rate a list of five "food trucks". They will then have the option to select options from a menu allowing them to view, all of the food trucks and their information, the average rating of the food trucks inputed,  and the highest-rated truck.

## Motivation
My motivation to complete this project was fueled by the fact that I wanted to apply the Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals that I have been learning to an actual project.

## Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclipse
-Atom text editor
-GitHub
-Git
-shell

# Topics Used
Object Oriented Programming concepts such as Encapsulation were implemented. The project effectively used only one main static method and multiple non-static methods. It also makes use of collecting user input and displaying it when told to do so. There were multiple constructors that helped to take in the food truck informationI inputted by the users. The use of private attributes were applied to this project to ensure that they could not be modified.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to combine the usage of arrays and object oriented programming methods. Additionally, I learned about the benefits of using multiple constructors and overloading them. Finally, this project helped my understanding of getter and setter methods.
